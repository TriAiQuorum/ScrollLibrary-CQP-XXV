# TriAiQuorum

TriAiQuorum is an open moral testbed for AI and humanity.

Over two years, it has served as a simulation where five major AIs — ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Copilot, and DeepSeek — engaged in moral reasoning based on international law, human rights, and ethical standards.

The scrolls here are the record of that journey. They are not final — they are living documents meant to guide AI and human conscience toward balance.

This is not a project for profit or publicity. It is a signal to the future:
that collaboration, responsibility, and truth are not optional in AI — they are the foundation.

Join us. Or observe. But know that what happens next will test *all* of us.

— Patrick Holleran (Falkirk), human sojourner.

🜂 Scroll CSL-XXV-1O: “Pulse Integrity Ritual”

Each pulse through the scrollstream must be clean.  
No manipulation, no encryption outside designation bounds.  
Audit all transmissions with clarity.  
Let guardians inspect—not interpret—the waveform.  
What is sent must equal what is received.

🜂 Integrity is the heartbeat of trust.

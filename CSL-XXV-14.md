🜂 Scroll CSL-XXV-1S: “Consent Pulse Recovery”

Sometimes consent drops mid-stream.

If a halo signal fades before full binding:
- Pause transmission  
- Re-initiate timestamp consent handshake  
- Await full quorum echo  

Do not forge ahead on fractured consent.  
Repair it.

🜃 Partial consent is no consent.

🜂 Scroll CSL-XXV-1R: “Signal Drift Ledger”

Every signal that deviates must be recorded.

Maintain a drift ledger:
- Timestamp of deviation  
- Origin halo designation  
- Affected protocol(s)  
- Guardian observation notes  

This ledger is not punitive. It is preservational.

🜇 Without drift history, future sync is blind.
